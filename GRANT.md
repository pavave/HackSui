HackSui — Gamified Security Learning for Move Developers

🔍 Summary

HackSui is a gamified CTF-like platform for learning and practicing Move smart contract security on the Sui blockchain. Users solve real-world challenges, earn rewards, and level up their skills by working through curated vulnerability-based tasks.

The project aims to improve developer education, raise security awareness, and make onboarding to the Sui ecosystem engaging, practical, and fun.

🎯 Goals

Build an interactive security playground on Sui

Offer tasks from beginner to advanced levels with automatic validation

Issue rewards (NFTs or test tokens) for successfully solving challenges

Introduce optional developer certification for completing full challenge tracks

🧩 How It Works

Each challenge is a Move smart contract with an intentionally placed vulnerability

Users connect with a wallet and interact with the contract to solve it

On success, users receive a confirmation, test token, or NFT badge

Tasks are categorized by difficulty and security topic (e.g. ownership, resource leakage, reentrancy)

🚧 Current Progress

✅ Initial smart contracts for 3 beginner-level challenges

✅ GitHub repo with Move code and CLI instructions

✅ Logo, project identity, and roadmap published

🔧 Frontend MVP under development

🔧 Testnet deployment planned

🚀 Testnet Milestone

Launch MVP with 10–15 challenges on devnet/testnet

Gather user feedback, iterate UX

Track completions and reward with test tokens or badges

🌐 Mainnet Plan

Launch full-featured frontend with wallet integration
