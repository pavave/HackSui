# HackSui — Gamified Security Learning for Move Developers

## 🔍 Summary
HackSui is a gamified CTF-like platform for learning and practicing Move smart contract security on the Sui blockchain. Users solve real-world challenges, get test tokens, and earn rewards for completing vulnerability-based tasks.

The project aims to improve developer education, raise security awareness, and make onboarding to the Sui ecosystem engaging and effective.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build an interactive security playground on Sui.
- Offer tasks from beginner to advanced levels with automatic validation.
- Issue rewards (NFTs or test tokens) for successfully solving challenges.
- Optionally introduce developer certification for completing sets of tasks.

## 🧩 How It Works
- Each challenge is a smart contract with a known vulnerability.
- Users connect via wallet, interact with contracts, and try to solve tasks.
- On success, they receive a confirmation, test token, or badge.
- Tasks are graded by difficulty and theme (e.g. ownership, reentrancy, resource leakage).

## 🏗️ Current Progress
- ✅ Initial smart contracts for 3 beginner-level challenges.
- ✅ GitHub repo with Move code and CLI instructions.
- ✅ Logo, project identity, and roadmap.
- 🛠️ Frontend MVP under development.
- 🧪 Plan for testnet deployment.

## 🧪 Testnet Goal
- Launch MVP with 10–15 challenges in devnet/testnet.
- Validate feedback and improve UX.
- Track user completions and reward via test tokens.

## 🚀 Mainnet Plan
- Full-featured frontend with wallet integration.
- Onchain challenge verification.
- Optional leaderboard and public developer certificates.
- Custom token (optional) for rewards and reputation.

## 💰 Requested Grant
We are requesting **$5,000** in support for:
- Development time
- Hosting frontend/backend infrastructure
- Bug bounty support for task creation
- Security review of contracts
