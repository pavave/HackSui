# 🛡️ HackSui — Gamified Security Playground for Sui

**HackSui** is a gamified Capture-the-Flag (CTF) platform for learning and practicing smart contract security in the Sui blockchain ecosystem.

Users interact with vulnerable Move contracts, complete security challenges, and earn test tokens as rewards — all while mastering the fundamentals of Move and smart contract safety.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Educate developers through real-world Move security challenges.
- Simulate a hacker-style environment to test knowledge and skills.
- Issue test tokens (or NFTs in the future) as proof of completion.
- Optionally introduce developer certification based on progression.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- Every challenge is a Move contract with an intentional vulnerability.
- Players connect their wallet (Sui CLI / frontend in progress).
- They solve the task by interacting with the contract and submitting a fix or exploit.
- On success, they receive a test token or confirmation.
- Challenges are categorized by difficulty: beginner / intermediate / advanced.
